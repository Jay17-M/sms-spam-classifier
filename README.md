# sms-spam-classifier

Project overview :

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that accurately classifies SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). The goal is to automate the detection of unsolicited and potentially harmful text messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classification algorithms.

Objectives:

1.Preprocess and clean raw SMS text data.

2.Extract meaningful features using NLP techniques (e.g., Bag of Words, TF-IDF).

3.Train multiple machine learning classifiers.

4.Evaluate models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5.Deploy a simple web interface (optional) using Streamlit or Flask.

Technologies Used:

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK / spaCy (for text preprocessing)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
